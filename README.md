## Macros
Macros are keyboard shortcuts that can execute commands whenever you click the associated button.

## Party Chat
Party Chat allows you to chat with multiple players at once - even if they're not on the same server with you!

## QOL
We have a custom, better unified /tick freeze command (/mflp freezeGame) instead of /tick freeze and /tick unfreeze.
